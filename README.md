Main plugin of UnioCraft Skyblock server. Created in 2015 and kept getting updates until 2020. Uploaded for archive purposes.

**Note:** It's so far away from SOLID, DRY or Agile structures. I created it's structure when I was a complete newbie. So it's hard to read and maintain. I don't recommend anyone to use it but it has some good solutions to many problems. Also even though it's ugly, it's fully functional so it works lol.

## Features
- Automatic ranking depending on Island level.
- Virtual block system. It's useful for leveling without making ugly islands. (/sanalblok)
- Virtual block vaults. (/blokdepo)
- Queueing and automating announcements made by players. (/duyuru)
- Weekly level lists and rewarding. Similar to /is top but every week it's resetting. (/topweekly)
- MineResetLite mine resetting time placeholder.
- Command whitelist system. It will only allow players to use commands that set in the config.
- Chat color system. (/renk)
- Custom skull system. VIP players can get skulls every week. We are getting skull data directly from Mojang. So it works with our custom skin system.
- Chat formatting and giving custom tags to players depending on their levels.
- Anti grief and cheat methods.
- Teleporting from void to spawn automatically.
- Anti fly zones.
- Anti loot steal.
- Ender pearl cooldown.
- Automatic log cleaner.
- Many more but I'm tired of writing.
